After Plotting the graphs with a bias ( W_0 ) of 0. The assumption that 
the graph splitting the two data sets will be passing throught the origin 
fails. From graph in (Fisher_2.jpg), the points weat re not split by the decission
boundary, however if we translated the line to lie in between 
the points; it would split the points. The requirement is to find this translation.

---------------------
After Aquiring Mean 1,and Mean 2.
by translating the line with the average value of the x2 axis between the two means,
it translates the decision boundary to split the two points.
